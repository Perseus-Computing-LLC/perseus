# Perseus — Living Roadmap

**Repo:** https://github.com/tcconnally/perseus  
**Workspace:** current repo checkout

**CLI:** `~/.local/bin/perseus`  
**Last updated:** @date format="YYYY-MM-DD"

## What Perseus Is

Perseus is a **live context engine for AI assistants**. It solves the cold-start problem:
instead of burning the first N turns of a session on orientation, Perseus resolves environment
state *before* it enters the context window. The assistant receives facts, not instructions
to go find facts.

Perseus is **assistant-agnostic**. It was built alongside Hermes Agent but is not tied to it.
The renderer output is plain markdown. The checkpoint store is plain YAML. Any AI assistant
that can read a file or receive stdin can use Perseus.

**Core insight:** Resolve environment state *before* it hits the context window.

**Pythia** (renamed from "oracle" — Oracle Corp is litigious) is the MVP. Renderer and
checkpoints feed it.

### Components

|---|---|
| `perseus render <file.md>` | Resolves `@perseus` source doc → plain markdown |
| `perseus graph <file.md> [--json]` | Builds a static directive graph without executing directives |
| `perseus prefetch <file.md> [--json]` | Applies opt-in pre-fetch rules to the static graph and warms directive caches |
| `perseus validate --schema SCHEMA [payload|-]` | Validates a payload against a Perseus schema; `--json` for CI/agents |
| `perseus checkpoint --task "..."` | Writes timestamped YAML to `~/.perseus/checkpoints/` |
| `perseus recover` | Prints latest checkpoint (workspace + TTL aware) |
| `perseus diff` | Shows what changed between last two checkpoints |
| `perseus suggest "<task>"` | Emits structured Pythia prompt over live env snapshot |
| `perseus suggest "<task>" --llm ollama` | Pipes oracle prompt to local model, no round-trip |
| `perseus init [workspace]` | Scaffolds `.perseus/context.md` for a new workspace |
| `perseus launchd` | Scaffolds macOS LaunchAgent plist for scheduled render |

## Workspace State

@query "git log --oneline -5" fallback="git log unavailable"
@query "git status --short" fallback="clean"

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

These apply to every agent working in this repo. They are not up for discussion.

1. **Single file.** `perseus.py` stays one file. No package structure, no `setup.py`, no
   sub-modules. Internal section headers and grouping are fine. File splits are not.
2. **`pyyaml` is the only dependency.** Do not add deps without explicit approval.
3. **Tests before commit.** All existing tests must pass. New behavior needs new tests.
4. **Spec follows code.** When behavior changes, update the relevant `spec/*.md`. The code
   is the truth.
5. **Keep the mythology.** Perseus, Pythia, Agora, Daedalus, Medusa problem. Don't rename.
6. **Backward compatibility.** Existing `@directive` syntax and config keys must not break.
   New behavior is additive or behind config flags.
7. **Executors, not architects.** Agents implement tasks as specified. Architecture,
   sequencing, and naming decisions belong to the project owner. If a task conflicts with
   a constraint, mark it Blocked — do not resolve it unilaterally.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Close the Pythia Loop ← COMPLETE ✅

**P1.1** — Pythia as live Hermes skill call  
**P1.2** — `@query` directive  
**P1.3** — Hermes workdir auto-injection via `no_agent` cron watchdog

---

### Phase 2 — Real Project Opt-In ← COMPLETE ✅

**P2.1** — `@read` directive  
**P2.2** — `@env` directive  
**P2.3** — `@if/@else/@endif`  
**P2.4** — `@include`

---

### Phase 3 — Reliability + Scale ← COMPLETE ✅

**P3.1** — Cache layer (`@cache session` / `@cache ttl=N`)  
**P3.2** — Smart `perseus recover --workspace`  
**P3.3** — `@constraint...@end`

---

### Phase 4 — Self-Bootstrapping ← COMPLETE ✅

Perseus renders its own roadmap live. This file is now a `@perseus` source.

**P4.1** — `command:` variant in `@services`  
**P4.2** — ROADMAP.md converted to live `@perseus` source  
**P4.3** — `perseus init`  
**P4.4** — `--version` flag, v0.4 bump

---

### Hardening Pass ← COMPLETE ✅

Completed after alpha audit by Rovo Dev. Not a named phase — a quality gate.

- Safer workspace inference for `render`
- Quote-aware `@read` and `@include` parsing helpers
- Visible `@if` parse errors and unmatched-block warnings
- Workspace-boundary checks for `@read` / `@include`
- `@query` and `@services command` trust gates
- Structural frontmatter parsing for `@skills`
- `stale_after`-aware recover logic
- `@query` nested-quote parsing fix; `render --output` flag
- macOS `perseus launchd` scaffolding
- 27-test pytest suite

---

### Phase 5 — Pythia Autonomy + Agora ← COMPLETE ✅

Phase 5 has two parallel tracks. Both are complete. One remaining item (P5A.4) is tracked
as task-07.

#### Track A — Pythia Autonomy

Make Pythia self-contained — no assistant round-trip required.

**P5A.1 — `--llm` flag** (`tasks/task-02`)  
Pipe the oracle prompt directly to a locally running model.
- Primary target: **Ollama** (`http://localhost:11434`, OpenAI-compatible API)
- Secondary: **llama.cpp server** (also OpenAI-compatible)
- No new dependencies — stdlib `urllib` only
- Configurable via `llm:` block in `~/.perseus/config.yaml`
- Flags: `--llm ollama|llamacpp|openai-compat`, `--model <name>`, `--model-url <url>`

**P5A.2 — Oracle recommendation log** (`tasks/task-02`)  
Every `perseus suggest` call appends a structured entry to `~/.perseus/oracle_log.jsonl`.
This is the seed of a future fine-tuning dataset for Daedalus (Phase 6).
- Schema: `{version, timestamp, task, env_snapshot, prompt, response, provider, model, accepted}`
- `accepted` is `null` at log time — a future command will flip it
- Append-only JSONL; logging failure is a warning, not a fatal error

**P5A.3 — Checkpoint diffing** (`tasks/task-03`)  
`perseus diff` shows what changed between the last two checkpoints.
- Default: diff two most recent in the store
- `--workspace` filters to a specific workspace
- `--a` / `--b` select by index or filename
- Human-readable output; no machine-parseable format needed

**P5A.4 — Multi-workspace checkpoint namespacing**  
Harden `perseus recover --workspace` with per-workspace `latest-<hash>.yaml` pointers so
recovery is reliable across multiple active workspaces.  
*No task file yet — project owner will write it after P5A.1–3 land.*

#### Track B — Agora

The **Agora** is Perseus's async agent coordination substrate. It makes the `tasks/` directory
a first-class Perseus feature rather than a convention held together by markdown.

Named for the Athenian public square — where free people arrived independently, saw what work
was posted, claimed it, completed it, and moved on. No central dispatcher.

**P5B.1 — Formal task schema** (`tasks/task-04`)  
Task files get YAML frontmatter so tooling can parse state without reading prose:
```yaml
---
id: task-04
title: "..."
status: open          # open | in_progress | completed | blocked
scope: medium         # small | medium | large
depends_on: []
claimed_by: null
opened: 2026-05-18
closed: null
---
```

**P5B.2 — `perseus agora` subcommand** (`tasks/task-04`)  
Thin CLI over the tasks directory:
- `perseus agora list` — grouped by status
- `perseus agora claim <id> --agent <name>` — sets status + claimed_by
- `perseus agora complete <id>` — sets status + closed date
- `perseus agora status` — summary view

**P5B.3 — `@agora` renderer directive** (`tasks/task-04`)  
Embeds a live task board in any rendered context file:
```
@agora [status=open] [scope=small,medium]
```
Renders as a markdown table. Replaces static task lists in `AGENTS.md` and `tasks/README.md`.

**P5B.4 — Provider-agnostic config** (`tasks/task-01`)  
Rename `hermes:` config section → `assistant:`. Make `SKILLS_DIR` and `SESSIONS_DIR`
configurable via `PERSEUS_SKILLS_DIR` / `PERSEUS_SESSIONS_DIR` env vars (old `HERMES_*`
vars remain as fallback). Rewrite `spec/integration.md` as a multi-adapter guide covering
Hermes, Rovo Dev, Claude Code, Cursor, and generic assistants.

---

### Phase 6 — Daedalus ← COMPLETE ✅

**Daedalus** is the local autonomous scoring model that powers Pythia without any external
round-trip. Named for the master craftsman who built autonomous mechanical intelligences —
the bronze giant Talos, the golden servants — tools that operated on their own once made.

Daedalus is what Pythia runs on when it no longer needs to phone home.

The `oracle_log.jsonl` built in Phase 5A is the training data seed.

**P6.1 — Dataset curation tooling**  
`perseus oracle accept <log-id>` / `reject <log-id>` — flip the `accepted` field in
`oracle_log.jsonl`. Simple CLI for the human to label good recommendations.

**P6.2 — Dataset export**  
`perseus oracle export` — emit labeled entries as a fine-tuning dataset in a standard format
(JSONL with `prompt`/`completion` pairs). Targets small models: Mistral 7B, Phi-3-mini.

**P6.3 — Local model integration**  
Wire Daedalus as the default `--llm` target once a fine-tuned model exists. The scoring
model runs locally via Ollama. No internet required. No assistant round-trip required.

**P6.4 — Cross-session learning**  
Scores improve with usage patterns. The more `perseus suggest` is used and labeled, the
better Daedalus's recommendations become.

**Design constraint:** Daedalus is a model you run, not a service you call. It must work
offline. The implementation stays inside `perseus.py` — Daedalus is not a separate daemon.

**Implementation note (2026-05-18):** The Perseus side of Daedalus shipped in task-06.
`perseus oracle accept/reject/log/export` and `--llm daedalus` provider routing are live.
The model itself is a user step — fine-tune your chosen small model on the exported
dataset and push to Ollama under the `llm.daedalus_model` name (default `perseus-daedalus`).

---

### Phase 5C — Context Health (Daedalus v1) ← COMPLETE ✅

Independent of the trained Daedalus model, task-05 shipped **deterministic context
maintenance heuristics** as the first Daedalus-shaped workflow:

- `perseus health [--workspace]` — markdown maintenance report (stdout)
- `@health` directive — embeds the same report inline
- Heuristics: stale checkpoints, near-duplicate checkpoint windows, large `.perseus/context.md`,
  old completed Agora tasks
- Configurable thresholds under the `health:` config block
- Read-only — never modifies files

The naming is intentional: this is the maintenance layer. The trained scoring model in
Phase 6 is the autonomous version.

---

### Phase 7 — Mnēmē: Narrative Project Memory ← COMPLETE ✅

**Mnēmē** (Μνήμη) was the original Muse of Memory — not a log, not a snapshot, but the
*distilled narrative* of experience. She answers the question no snapshot can: *how did we
get here?*

Perseus solves cold-start. Mnēmē solves *arc*: the decisions made three weeks ago, the
approach tried and rejected, the constraint added after a painful bug. The raw material
already exists in checkpoints and the oracle log. Mnēmē distills it.

**P7.1 — Narrative store and deterministic distillation**  
Per-workspace narrative file at `~/.perseus/memory/<workspace-hash>.md`. Assembled
deterministically from checkpoints (decisions, task history) and oracle log (patterns,
accepted recommendations). No LLM required for v1.

**P7.2 — LLM-assisted distillation**  
Optional `memory.llm_provider` config key enables richer narrative via the existing
`run_llm` infrastructure. Incremental update and full compaction prompts.

**P7.3 — `@memory` renderer directive**  
Injects the narrative inline, with optional `focus=` argument to extract a single section.

**P7.4 — Auto-update on checkpoint write**  
`cmd_checkpoint` silently calls memory update when `memory.auto_update=True`. Every
checkpoint automatically advances the narrative. Compounding value.

**P7.5 — `perseus memory query`**  
Deterministic section search or LLM-answering against the narrative. Read-only.

Full spec: `tasks/task-12-mneme-narrative-memory.md`

---

## Phase 11 — Internal Hardening (Complete)

**Goal:** Make Perseus safe to extend rapidly. No user-facing behavior changes.

### 11A: DIRECTIVE_REGISTRY (task-25) ✅

Single `DirectiveSpec` NamedTuple + `DIRECTIVE_REGISTRY` dict as the canonical
source of truth for all directive metadata. The regex, dispatch chain, LSP
completion tables, and hover safety checks all derive from the registry.

**Why it came first:** Every future directive (schema validation, pre-fetch hooks,
generative context) would have to be added in 5-7 places without this. With it,
one registry entry + one resolver function.

### 11B: `perseus doctor` (task-26) ✅

Readiness probe command with 10 checks (config, context file, render settings,
checkpoint age, Mnēmē narrative, federation, oracle log, serve loopback,
directive registry). Supports `--json` for CI/agent consumption.

### 11C: `--json` Agent Surfaces (task-28) ✅

Add `--json` flag to 6 commands: `oracle infer-labels`, `oracle drift`,
`llm ping`, `memory status`, `memory federation list`, `memory federation pull`.
Stable JSON contracts for agent consumption, documented in
`docs/AGENT_SURFACES.md` and linked from the README CLI reference.

**Status:** Complete.

### 11D: LSP Integration Tests (task-27) ✅

Real JSON-RPC subprocess tests: spawn `perseus serve --lsp --stdio`, send
`initialize`, `textDocument/didOpen`, verify `publishDiagnostics`, test
completion and hover responses against the DIRECTIVE_REGISTRY.

Also covers shutdown/exit, malformed JSON-RPC, the TCP transport smoke, and the
explicit mutation gate for `perseus.compactMemory`.

### 11E: Split Tests by Subsystem (task-29) ✅

Split `tests/test_perseus.py` into subsystem files plus `tests/conftest.py`.
At Phase 11 close the suite collected 272 tests. After Phase 12 it reached
283 passed, 1 skipped; after Phase 13 it reached 297 passed, 1 skipped; after
Phase 14A it reached 300 passed, 1 skipped; after Phase 14B it reached
304 passed, 1 skipped (sandbox-blocked TCP bind; the same TCP smoke passes
outside the sandbox).
- `test_oracle.py` — suggest, oracle log, drift, infer-labels
- `test_memory.py` — Mnēmē narrative, federation
- `test_lsp.py` — LSP helpers, framing, diagnostics

No code changes to `perseus.py`. Mechanical file splitting + `conftest.py`
for shared fixtures. Do this last so all new tests land first.

---

## Phase 12 — Schema Validation Engine

**Goal:** Formalized context quality assurance — Perseus validates that resolved
context is well-formed before injection.

**Why this is next:** It's the most concrete future direction, the proof-of-concept
`@query schema=` modifier already exists, and it directly strengthens the
"resolve-before-context" thesis. If context is resolved but *wrong*, you've
traded the pre-flight tax for a garbage-in problem. Schema validation closes
that gap.

### 12A: Schema DSL & validation engine (task-30) ✅

- Define a YAML-based schema language for context blocks
- Validate `@query`, `@read`, `@env` outputs against declared schemas
- Schema files live in `.perseus/schemas/` per workspace
- New directive: `@validate schema="path" ...@end` wrapping a block

**Decision:** Phase 12 uses option **B** — a minimal built-in schema validator
implemented in pure Python. `pyyaml` remains the only required dependency.

The proof-of-concept added `pykwalify` which violates constraint #2 ("pyyaml is
the only dependency"). Rejected options:

  **A:** Get explicit owner approval for pykwalify as a second dependency
  **C:** Make pykwalify an optional soft dependency — `try: import pykwalify`
  with graceful fallback to a minimal built-in validator

The built-in validator intentionally covers type checks, required fields,
sequences, regex patterns, and enums. It is not full JSON Schema.

**Status:** Complete.

### 12B: Directive-level schema annotations (task-31) ✅

Once the registry exists (✅ done), add an optional `output_schema` field to
`DirectiveSpec`. Directives that declare a schema get automatic validation
on every render — no per-invocation `schema=` modifier needed.

Per-invocation `schema=` remains stronger than registry-level `output_schema`
so local data contracts can override broad directive invariants.

**Status:** Complete.

### 12C: `perseus validate` CLI command (task-32) ✅

Standalone validation: run schemas against a rendered document or a specific
directive's output without a full render pass. Useful for CI gates.

Supports file input or stdin, human output or `--json`, and returns non-zero for
validation failures.

**Status:** Complete.

---

## Phase 13 — Predictive Pre-fetching

**Goal:** Perseus anticipates what context the AI will need *next* and pre-fetches
it, reducing even the render-time latency.

### 13A: Directive dependency graph (task-33) ✅

The registry declares what each directive reads and produces. Build a static
dependency graph: if `@query "git status"` is in the doc, and the oracle log
shows it's almost always followed by `git diff`, pre-cache the diff output.

**Status:** Complete. `perseus graph <source> [--json]` scans a source document
without executing directives, skips fenced code blocks, and reports registry
metadata plus static resource hints.

### 13B: Pattern-based pre-fetch rules (task-34) ✅

Use explicit, user-configured patterns to identify recurring directive
sequences. Configurable pre-fetch rules in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
prefetch:
  rules:
    - trigger: "@query \"git status\""
      prefetch: "@query \"git diff --stat\" @cache ttl=300"
    - trigger: "@agora status=open"
      prefetch: "@memory focus=decisions @cache ttl=300"
```

**Status:** Complete. `perseus prefetch <source> [--json]` builds the static
graph, matches configured triggers, and executes only cacheable inline
prefetch directives. It reports ran/skipped/failed entries, requires cache
modifiers for prefetch outputs, and respects existing trust gates such as
`render.allow_query_shell`.

### 13C: Daedalus-powered adaptive pre-fetch (task-35) ✅

When a fine-tuned Daedalus model exists, it scores which pre-fetch candidates to
activate based on the current task context. This is where Daedalus transitions
from "label UI + export" to an active runtime component.

**Status:** Complete. Adaptive prefetch is opt-in under `prefetch.adaptive`.
Deterministic scoring uses recent oracle/Mnēmē pattern text with no LLM. The
Daedalus backend routes through existing LLM plumbing, fails gracefully to the
deterministic scorer, and only scores predeclared cache-warming candidates. It
does not generate new context prose or cross the Phase 14/15 decision gate.

## Phase 14 — Adaptive Self-Optimizing Oracle

**Goal:** Pythia's recommendations improve autonomously from real usage signals.

### 14A: Reinforcement signal collection (task-36) ✅

The oracle log already captures accept/reject. Extend it with:
- Task completion signal (did the accepted recommendation lead to a completed
  checkpoint?)
- Error rate (did the session hit errors after following the recommendation?)
- Time-to-completion

**Status:** Complete. `perseus oracle outcomes [--dry-run] [--json]`
correlates accepted and inferred-accepted oracle entries with subsequent
checkpoints and writes deterministic `outcome` objects containing completion,
error-rate, checkpoint-count, and time-to-completion signals.

### 14B: Online scoring adjustment (task-37) ✅

Daedalus updates its scoring weights incrementally as new labeled data arrives.
No full retrain needed — moving average over recent accept/reject ratios per
tool/skill path.

**Status:** Complete. `perseus suggest` now computes deterministic
outcome-weight hints from recent oracle entries with task-36 `outcome` objects.
Successful completed outcomes boost related recommendation tokens; incomplete
or error-heavy outcomes lower them. The hints are transparent in the oracle
prompt and omitted when no outcome data exists.

### 14C: A/B recommendation testing

Occasionally present alternative recommendations alongside the primary one.
Track which the user follows. Exploration/exploitation tradeoff for the oracle.

## ═══════════════════════════════════════════
## DECISION GATE — Resolver vs Generator
## ═══════════════════════════════════════════

**Phases 11–14 keep Perseus as a *resolver* — it takes live environment state
and presents it faithfully. The value proposition is trust: what Perseus gives
you is true.**

Phase 15 makes Perseus a *generator*. It starts putting words in the context
window that didn't come directly from the environment. Even with guardrails,
this is a philosophical shift:

- **Resolver Perseus:** "Here are the facts."
- **Generator Perseus:** "Here are the facts, and here's what I think they mean."

This changes the trust model, the error surface, the testing requirements, and
the competitive positioning. It might be the right move — but it's not a
technical decision, it's a product decision.

**Questions to answer before proceeding past Phase 14:**

1. Does Perseus's competitive advantage come from being a *trustworthy resolver*
   or an *intelligent context curator*? These are different products.
2. If Perseus generates context, who is liable when generated context causes
   the AI to make a bad decision? This matters for adoption.
3. Is the generative capability better as a Perseus feature or as something the
   consuming AI does itself with Perseus's resolved context as input?

**Decision brief:** [`docs/RESOLVER_VS_GENERATOR.md`](docs/RESOLVER_VS_GENERATOR.md)
recommends keeping Phase 14 inside the resolver boundary and treating Phase 15
generation as an explicit opt-in product pivot.

---

## Phase 15 — Generative Context Enhancement (Contingent)

**Goal:** Perseus can *elaborate* sparse context using an LLM, with strict
verification guardrails. **Only proceed if the decision gate above is resolved.**

### 15A: Verified elaboration for `@read`

When `@read` pulls a config value, Perseus can optionally explain *what it
means* by cross-referencing the project's docs or README. The elaboration is
verified against the raw value — if it contradicts the source, it's dropped.

### 15B: Guardrail framework

Every generated elaboration must pass:
1. Source citation (which raw context was the basis?)
2. Contradiction check (does the elaboration contradict any resolved directive?)
3. Confidence threshold (below threshold → omit, don't guess)

---

## Future Direction: Decentralized Federation

Deepen federation to securely share context across decentralized workspaces or
organizations. Dynamic access control, conflict resolution, provable data lineage.
This changes the deployment model from single-node to distributed — an
infrastructure and trust boundary question separate from the resolver/generator
decision above.

## Etymology

**Perseus** slew Medusa not by meeting her gaze but by watching her reflection in Athena's polished shield. The Medusa here is the paralysis of facing your environment directly — too many tools, stale docs, no continuity between sessions. The mirror is resolved context: you see the situation clearly without being turned to stone by it.

**Hermes** gave Perseus three gifts for the quest: winged sandals for speed, a kibisis to carry what could not be looked at directly, and guidance through the unknown. This Perseus returns the favor — giving Hermes a way to navigate any workspace without the orientation tax.

**Pythia** was the Oracle at Delphi who spoke for Apollo. Pilgrims came with impossible questions; she gave them the truth in a form they could act on. The Tool Oracle works the same way: you come with a task and a tangled environment; it gives you ranked paths forward. She didn't need to know everything — she needed to know what mattered *now*.

**The Graeae** — the three grey sisters who shared a single eye — are what you're working around. Three sisters who can only see one thing at a time: the current context, the tool choice, or the session history. Perseus stole the eye and made them see all three at once. So does the renderer.
