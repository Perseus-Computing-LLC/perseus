# Perseus — Living Roadmap

**Repo:** https://github.com/tcconnally/perseus  
**Workspace:** `/workspace/perseus`  
**Skill:** `perseus-context-engine` (installed at `~/.hermes/skills/`)  
**CLI:** `~/.local/bin/perseus`  
**Last updated:** @date format="YYYY-MM-DD"

---

## What Perseus Is

Perseus is a **live context engine for AI assistants**. It solves the cold-start problem:
instead of burning the first N turns of a session on orientation, Perseus resolves environment
state *before* it enters the context window. The assistant receives facts, not instructions
to go find facts.

Perseus is **assistant-agnostic**. It was built alongside Hermes Agent but is not tied to it.
The renderer output is plain markdown. The checkpoint store is plain YAML. Any AI assistant
that can read a file or receive stdin can use Perseus.

**Core insight:** Resolve environment state *before* it hits the context window.

**Pythia** (renamed from "oracle" — Oracle Corp is litigious) is the MVP. Renderer and
checkpoints feed it.

### Components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Renderer** | Resolves `@directive` blocks in `.md` files before context window | ✅ Complete |
| **Checkpoints** | Lightweight explicit session recovery snapshots | ✅ Complete |

| **Agora** | Async agent coordination substrate — task queue + `@agora` directive | ✅ Phase 5C |
| **Health** | Deterministic context maintenance heuristics — `perseus health` + `@health` directive (Daedalus v1) | ✅ Phase 5E |
| **Daedalus** | Local autonomous scoring model — Pythia without a round-trip (dataset + routing shipped; model training is a user step) | ✅ Phase 6 |
| **Mnēmē** | Narrative project memory — distills checkpoints + oracle log into a per-workspace narrative | ✅ Phase 7 |
| **Federation** | Cross-workspace Mnēmē narrative aggregation via subscribable manifest | ✅ Phase 8.2 |
| **Templates** | Starter scaffolds for generic/hermes/rovodev/claude-code/cursor via `perseus init --template` | ✅ Phase 8 |
| **Serve** | Read-only HTTP view of workspace state | ✅ Phase 8 |
| **Inbox** | Per-workspace point-to-point message store + `@inbox` directive | ✅ Phase 8 |
| **Cron** | Cross-platform scheduler (macOS/Linux/BSD) — bridges launchd + systemd | ✅ Phase 8 |

## What's Built

### `perseus.py` — full CLI

@query "python3 /workspace/perseus/perseus.py --version"

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `perseus render <file.md>` | Resolves `@perseus` source doc → plain markdown |
| `perseus checkpoint --task "..."` | Writes timestamped YAML to `~/.perseus/checkpoints/` |
| `perseus recover` | Prints latest checkpoint (workspace + TTL aware) |
| `perseus diff` | Shows what changed between last two checkpoints |
| `perseus suggest "<task>"` | Emits structured Pythia prompt over live env snapshot |
| `perseus suggest "<task>" --llm ollama` | Pipes oracle prompt to local model, no round-trip |
| `perseus init [workspace]` | Scaffolds `.perseus/context.md` for a new workspace |
| `perseus launchd` | Scaffolds macOS LaunchAgent plist for scheduled render |

### Directives implemented

## Workspace State

@query "git -C /workspace/perseus log --oneline -5"
@query "git -C /workspace/perseus status --short"

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

These apply to every agent working in this repo. They are not up for discussion.

1. **Single file.** `perseus.py` stays one file. No package structure, no `setup.py`, no
   sub-modules. Internal section headers and grouping are fine. File splits are not.
2. **`pyyaml` is the only dependency.** Do not add deps without explicit approval.
3. **Tests before commit.** All existing tests must pass. New behavior needs new tests.
4. **Spec follows code.** When behavior changes, update the relevant `spec/*.md`. The code
   is the truth.
5. **Keep the mythology.** Perseus, Pythia, Agora, Daedalus, Medusa problem. Don't rename.
6. **Backward compatibility.** Existing `@directive` syntax and config keys must not break.
   New behavior is additive or behind config flags.
7. **Executors, not architects.** Agents implement tasks as specified. Architecture,
   sequencing, and naming decisions belong to the project owner. If a task conflicts with
   a constraint, mark it Blocked — do not resolve it unilaterally.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Close the Pythia Loop ← COMPLETE ✅

**P1.1** — Pythia as live Hermes skill call  
**P1.2** — `@query` directive  
**P1.3** — Hermes workdir auto-injection via `no_agent` cron watchdog

---

### Phase 2 — Real Project Opt-In ← COMPLETE ✅

**P2.1** — `@read` directive  
**P2.2** — `@env` directive  
**P2.3** — `@if/@else/@endif`  
**P2.4** — `@include`

---

### Phase 3 — Reliability + Scale ← COMPLETE ✅

**P3.1** — Cache layer (`@cache session` / `@cache ttl=N`)  
**P3.2** — Smart `perseus recover --workspace`  
**P3.3** — `@constraint...@end`

---

### Phase 4 — Self-Bootstrapping ← COMPLETE ✅

Perseus renders its own roadmap live. This file is now a `@perseus` source.

**P4.1** — `command:` variant in `@services`  
**P4.2** — ROADMAP.md converted to live `@perseus` source  
**P4.3** — `perseus init`  
**P4.4** — `--version` flag, v0.4 bump

---

### Hardening Pass ← COMPLETE ✅

Completed after alpha audit by Rovo Dev. Not a named phase — a quality gate.

- Safer workspace inference for `render`
- Quote-aware `@read` and `@include` parsing helpers
- Visible `@if` parse errors and unmatched-block warnings
- Workspace-boundary checks for `@read` / `@include`
- `@query` and `@services command` trust gates
- Structural frontmatter parsing for `@skills`
- `stale_after`-aware recover logic
- `@query` nested-quote parsing fix; `render --output` flag
- macOS `perseus launchd` scaffolding
- 27-test pytest suite

---

### Phase 5 — Pythia Autonomy + Agora ← COMPLETE ✅

Phase 5 has two parallel tracks. Both are complete. One remaining item (P5A.4) is tracked
as task-07.

#### Track A — Pythia Autonomy

Make Pythia self-contained — no assistant round-trip required.

**P5A.1 — `--llm` flag** (`tasks/task-02`)  
Pipe the oracle prompt directly to a locally running model.
- Primary target: **Ollama** (`http://localhost:11434`, OpenAI-compatible API)
- Secondary: **llama.cpp server** (also OpenAI-compatible)
- No new dependencies — stdlib `urllib` only
- Configurable via `llm:` block in `~/.perseus/config.yaml`
- Flags: `--llm ollama|llamacpp|openai-compat`, `--model <name>`, `--model-url <url>`

**P5A.2 — Oracle recommendation log** (`tasks/task-02`)  
Every `perseus suggest` call appends a structured entry to `~/.perseus/oracle_log.jsonl`.
This is the seed of a future fine-tuning dataset for Daedalus (Phase 6).
- Schema: `{version, timestamp, task, env_snapshot, prompt, response, provider, model, accepted}`
- `accepted` is `null` at log time — a future command will flip it
- Append-only JSONL; logging failure is a warning, not a fatal error

**P5A.3 — Checkpoint diffing** (`tasks/task-03`)  
`perseus diff` shows what changed between the last two checkpoints.
- Default: diff two most recent in the store
- `--workspace` filters to a specific workspace
- `--a` / `--b` select by index or filename
- Human-readable output; no machine-parseable format needed

**P5A.4 — Multi-workspace checkpoint namespacing**  
Harden `perseus recover --workspace` with per-workspace `latest-<hash>.yaml` pointers so
recovery is reliable across multiple active workspaces.  
*No task file yet — project owner will write it after P5A.1–3 land.*

#### Track B — Agora

The **Agora** is Perseus's async agent coordination substrate. It makes the `tasks/` directory
a first-class Perseus feature rather than a convention held together by markdown.

Named for the Athenian public square — where free people arrived independently, saw what work
was posted, claimed it, completed it, and moved on. No central dispatcher.

**P5B.1 — Formal task schema** (`tasks/task-04`)  
Task files get YAML frontmatter so tooling can parse state without reading prose:
```yaml
---
id: task-04
title: "..."
status: open          # open | in_progress | completed | blocked
scope: medium         # small | medium | large
depends_on: []
claimed_by: null
opened: 2026-05-18
closed: null
---
```

**P5B.2 — `perseus agora` subcommand** (`tasks/task-04`)  
Thin CLI over the tasks directory:
- `perseus agora list` — grouped by status
- `perseus agora claim <id> --agent <name>` — sets status + claimed_by
- `perseus agora complete <id>` — sets status + closed date
- `perseus agora status` — summary view

**P5B.3 — `@agora` renderer directive** (`tasks/task-04`)  
Embeds a live task board in any rendered context file:
```
@agora [status=open] [scope=small,medium]
```
Renders as a markdown table. Replaces static task lists in `AGENTS.md` and `tasks/README.md`.

**P5B.4 — Provider-agnostic config** (`tasks/task-01`)  
Rename `hermes:` config section → `assistant:`. Make `SKILLS_DIR` and `SESSIONS_DIR`
configurable via `PERSEUS_SKILLS_DIR` / `PERSEUS_SESSIONS_DIR` env vars (old `HERMES_*`
vars remain as fallback). Rewrite `spec/integration.md` as a multi-adapter guide covering
Hermes, Rovo Dev, Claude Code, Cursor, and generic assistants.

---

### Phase 6 — Daedalus ← COMPLETE ✅

**Daedalus** is the local autonomous scoring model that powers Pythia without any external
round-trip. Named for the master craftsman who built autonomous mechanical intelligences —
the bronze giant Talos, the golden servants — tools that operated on their own once made.

Daedalus is what Pythia runs on when it no longer needs to phone home.

The `oracle_log.jsonl` built in Phase 5A is the training data seed.

**P6.1 — Dataset curation tooling**  
`perseus oracle accept <log-id>` / `reject <log-id>` — flip the `accepted` field in
`oracle_log.jsonl`. Simple CLI for the human to label good recommendations.

**P6.2 — Dataset export**  
`perseus oracle export` — emit labeled entries as a fine-tuning dataset in a standard format
(JSONL with `prompt`/`completion` pairs). Targets small models: Mistral 7B, Phi-3-mini.

**P6.3 — Local model integration**  
Wire Daedalus as the default `--llm` target once a fine-tuned model exists. The scoring
model runs locally via Ollama. No internet required. No assistant round-trip required.

**P6.4 — Cross-session learning**  
Scores improve with usage patterns. The more `perseus suggest` is used and labeled, the
better Daedalus's recommendations become.

**Design constraint:** Daedalus is a model you run, not a service you call. It must work
offline. The implementation stays inside `perseus.py` — Daedalus is not a separate daemon.

**Implementation note (2026-05-18):** The Perseus side of Daedalus shipped in task-06.
`perseus oracle accept/reject/log/export` and `--llm daedalus` provider routing are live.
The model itself is a user step — fine-tune your chosen small model on the exported
dataset and push to Ollama under the `llm.daedalus_model` name (default `perseus-daedalus`).

---

### Phase 5C — Context Health (Daedalus v1) ← COMPLETE ✅

Independent of the trained Daedalus model, task-05 shipped **deterministic context
maintenance heuristics** as the first Daedalus-shaped workflow:

- `perseus health [--workspace]` — markdown maintenance report (stdout)
- `@health` directive — embeds the same report inline
- Heuristics: stale checkpoints, near-duplicate checkpoint windows, large `.perseus/context.md`,
  old completed Agora tasks
- Configurable thresholds under the `health:` config block
- Read-only — never modifies files

The naming is intentional: this is the maintenance layer. The trained scoring model in
Phase 6 is the autonomous version.

---

### Phase 7 — Mnēmē: Narrative Project Memory ← COMPLETE ✅

**Mnēmē** (Μνήμη) was the original Muse of Memory — not a log, not a snapshot, but the
*distilled narrative* of experience. She answers the question no snapshot can: *how did we
get here?*

Perseus solves cold-start. Mnēmē solves *arc*: the decisions made three weeks ago, the
approach tried and rejected, the constraint added after a painful bug. The raw material
already exists in checkpoints and the oracle log. Mnēmē distills it.

**P7.1 — Narrative store and deterministic distillation**  
Per-workspace narrative file at `~/.perseus/memory/<workspace-hash>.md`. Assembled
deterministically from checkpoints (decisions, task history) and oracle log (patterns,
accepted recommendations). No LLM required for v1.

**P7.2 — LLM-assisted distillation**  
Optional `memory.llm_provider` config key enables richer narrative via the existing
`run_llm` infrastructure. Incremental update and full compaction prompts.

**P7.3 — `@memory` renderer directive**  
Injects the narrative inline, with optional `focus=` argument to extract a single section.

**P7.4 — Auto-update on checkpoint write**  
`cmd_checkpoint` silently calls memory update when `memory.auto_update=True`. Every
checkpoint automatically advances the narrative. Compounding value.

**P7.5 — `perseus memory query`**  
Deterministic section search or LLM-answering against the narrative. Read-only.

Full spec: `tasks/task-12-mneme-narrative-memory.md`

---

### Phase 8 — Live Agent Orchestration ← MOSTLY COMPLETE ✅

With single-file, single-machine context resolved end-to-end, this arc adds
multi-agent message passing, a template gallery, and a read-only HTTP view.

**P8.1 — `@agent` directive ← COMPLETE ✅** (task-15)  
`@agent "cmd" [timeout=N] [strip=true] [fallback="text"]` — runs a local
subprocess and embeds its stdout inline. Gated by `render.allow_agent_shell`.
Composes with the existing `@cache` modifier (including `persist` and `mock`).

**P8.2 — Cross-workspace narrative ← DEFERRED**  
Federation design needs use-case clarification (which workspaces feed which?
how is conflict resolved?). Not blocking anything else.

**P8.3 — Agent inbox ← COMPLETE ✅** (task-16)  
Per-workspace inbox store at `~/.perseus/inbox/<workspace-hash>/`. CLI:
`perseus inbox send|list|read|dismiss`. Directive: `@inbox [unread=true] [limit=N]`.
Adds the comms layer that Agora's task-board model was missing.

**P8.4 — Template gallery ← COMPLETE ✅** (task-17)  
`templates/{generic,hermes,rovodev,claude-code,cursor}/.perseus/context.md`
shipped. `perseus init --template <name>` + `perseus init --list-templates`.
Discovery: `$PERSEUS_TEMPLATE_DIR` → `<dir-of-perseus.py>/templates/` →
embedded stub.

**P8.5 — `perseus serve` ← COMPLETE ✅** (task-18)  
Stdlib `http.server` view, read-only. Endpoints: `/`, `/context`, `/narrative`,
`/health`, `/agora`, `/checkpoint/latest`, `/oracle/log`. POST returns 405.
Default bind: `127.0.0.1`.

**Bonus — `perseus cron` ← COMPLETE ✅** (Phase 8 add-on)  
Cross-platform crontab scaffolder. Works on macOS, Linux, BSD — anywhere cron
is available. Recommended over the OS-specific launchd/systemd wrappers when
portability matters. `--install` mutates the user's crontab via
`crontab -l | edit | crontab -`.

---

### Phase 9 — Daedalus v2: Closed-loop autonomy ← SCOPED

Three task files scoped 2026-05-18. All open. Sequential dependency:
P9.1 produces inferred labels, P9.2 consumes them for trained pattern
extraction, P9.3 monitors drift across both.

| Sub-phase | Task | Scope | Open? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P9.1** — Self-rating loop | [task-20](tasks/task-20-daedalus-self-rating.md) | medium | 🔲 |
| **P9.2** — Trained pattern extraction in Mnēmē | [task-21](tasks/task-21-trained-pattern-extraction.md) | large | 🔲 |
| **P9.3** — Drift detection | [task-22](tasks/task-22-drift-detection.md) | medium | 🔲 |

**P9.1 — Self-rating loop**
After Pythia recommends X and the user's next checkpoint mentions a tool
overlapping with X, automatically increment a confidence signal in the
oracle log. Inferred labels never override explicit accept/reject. New
CLI: `perseus oracle infer-labels`.

**P9.2 — Trained pattern extraction in Mnēmē**
Replace rule-based pattern extraction in Mnēmē's "Patterns & Anti-patterns"
section with a Daedalus inference call when `memory.pattern_extractor:
daedalus` is configured. Graceful fallback to deterministic on any
failure. Bundles a `--format daedalus-patterns` export for training-data
curation.

**P9.3 — Drift detection**
Three drift metrics (acceptance rate, skill recommendation Jaccard,
Daedalus confidence) surfaced via `perseus oracle drift` and a new
`@drift` directive. All thresholds config-driven.

---

### Phase 10 — Editor integration ← SCOPED

Two task files scoped 2026-05-18. Sequential dependency: LSP first, then
the editor-specific wrapper.

| Sub-phase | Task | Scope | Open? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P10.1** — Perseus LSP server | [task-23](tasks/task-23-lsp-server.md) | large | 🔲 |
| **P10.2** — VSCode extension | [task-24](tasks/task-24-vscode-extension.md) | medium | 🔲 |

**P10.1 — Perseus LSP server**
`perseus serve --lsp --stdio|--tcp PORT` ships an LSP 3.17 subset:
diagnostics (unknown directives, malformed args, stale waypoints),
hover (live-resolved directive output), completion (directive names +
arg keys), codeLens ("▶ Render"), and `workspace/executeCommand`
(render, openCheckpoint, compactMemory). Hand-rolled JSON-RPC — no
`pygls` (single-file constraint preserved).

**P10.2 — VSCode extension**
First and only deliverable outside `perseus.py` (mechanically required
by VSCode's `.vsix` packaging). Lives at `editors/vscode/`. Thin
TypeScript wrapper: launches the LSP, adds tree view + status bar +
command palette entries. All real logic stays in the LSP.

---

### Beyond Phase 10

Open canvas. Candidates not yet scoped:

- **Phase 11** — Multi-agent inbox routing (route messages based on content
  to specific agents in a federation)
- **Phase 12** — Pattern-aware code actions in the LSP (refactor hints
  driven by Mnēmē patterns)
- **Phase 13** — JetBrains plugin, Helix LSP polish, Neovim plugin
- **Phase 14** — Team/server mode (multi-user federation with real
  publisher-side access control)

**Notes:**
- Container `$HOME` quirk: use absolute paths (`/home/hermeswebui`) not `~` in config
- No `gh` CLI — use `curl` + token from `/home/hermeswebui/.hermes/.env`
- Git push: `https://tcconnally:***@github.com/tcconnally/perseus.git`
- Services health check shows all ❌ URLError — expected (container can't reach host-network `localhost`). Not a bug.
- `@constraint` table flushed at end of document. Inline positioning is a future enhancement.
- Rovo Dev works on the repo asynchronously. Review commits before pulling; check `tasks/` for status.
